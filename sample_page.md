**Project description:** Peacefully at Times is a web app designed to help you unwind and connect with others.Visitors can select 10, 20, or 30 minutes as the duration of their meditation session, and the nature sounds that they would like to hear â€“ with the choice of rain, ocean, and forest sounds.Users can also post a message, and change the images associated with their post to reflect their spirit animal.

Peacefully All the Time was created as a group front-end project for DigitalCraft's September 2020 Cohort.
